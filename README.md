`docstore` is an example application that uses the key-process-value data structure from the book [Erlang and OTP in Action](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Erlang_and_OTP_in_Action/1zgzEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=erlang+and+otp+in+action&printsec=frontcover), to implement a distributed document store. The document store design comes from another book - [Distributed Computing with Go: Practical concurrency and parallelism for Go applications](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Distributed_Computing_with_Go/dulODwAAQBAJ?hl=en).
